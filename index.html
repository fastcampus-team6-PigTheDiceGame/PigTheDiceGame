            is a simple dice game first described in print in John Scarne in
            1945.[1] Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as
            they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing
            their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

            2. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule
            variations, including the use of two dice instead of one. Commercial
            variants of two-dice Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice,[2] and
            Skunk.[3] Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach
            probability concepts.

            3. Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia
            as "jeopardy dice games", where the dominant type of decision is
            whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential
            greater gains.[4]
